    /// The following are the "requirements" for this project:
    /// 
    /// 1. Implement Main() below so that a user can input a sentence.  Each word in that
    ///    sentence will be evaluated with the SpellChecker, which returns true for a word
    ///    that is spelled correctly and false for a word that is spelled incorrectly.  Display
    ///    out each *distinct* word that is misspelled.  That is, if a user uses the same misspelled
    ///    word more than once, simply output that word one time.
    ///    
    ///    Example:
    ///    Please enter a sentance: Salley sells seashellss by the seashore.  The shells Salley sells are surely by the sea.
    ///    Misspelled words: Salley seashellss
    ///    
    /// 2. The concrete implementation of SpellChecker depends on two other implementations of ISpellChecker, DictionaryDotComSpellChecker
    ///    and MnemonicSpellCheckerIBeforeE.  You will need to implement those classes.  See those classes for details.
    ///    
    /// 3. There are covering unit tests in the SpellChecker.Tests library that should be implemented as well.
